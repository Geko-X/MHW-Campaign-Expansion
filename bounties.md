# Bounties

Bounties offer material rewards for completing certain objectives. Each player can hold one bounty at a time. Bounties are completed automatically when the the player who collected the bounty achieves the objective. Bounty rewards are awarded when returning from a hunt.

### Picking Bounties
Bounties are picked randomly by rolling a d20. The player rolls 3 bounties and picks one. You may choose to discard a bounty at any time.

### Collecting Rewards
Roll a d12 to see what reward is collected. You may roll as many times as specified in the bounty reward.
