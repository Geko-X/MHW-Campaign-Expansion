# Geko_X's MHW Board Game Campaign Expansion

This is a "campaign expansion" for the MHW Board Game. It adds:
* Instructions for running the board game as more of a TTRPG, with someone acting as a Game Master (GM) - this should be a 5th (or 0th?) player, but they could be a hunter as well
* A few extra layers of campaign progression
  * Forge upgrades and unlocks
  * Canteen upgrades and unlocks
  * A bounty system
  * Palico use and progression
  * Material exchange and purchase
* Some changes to hunts, based on the MHW:Iceborne Board Game demo (turf wars!)
* Some new actions to take during hunts, including traps
* Small balance tweaks to some weapons and armor cards to fit in with all the other additions
* And probably a few more things that I've forgotten

This is an evolving homebrew expansion. Things will change :)

Please note that I'm currently running a longish campaign using this expansion!

The [Player Handbook](https://github.com/Geko-X/MHW-Campaign-Expansion/wiki/Player-Handbook) contains everything that a player (and GM) will need to know. It covers the bulk of the changes.

The [GM Handbook](https://github.com/Geko-X/MHW-Campaign-Expansion/wiki/GM-Handbook) has everything a GM should know. This will contain "secret information" that if you're running a campaign, may not want your players to know.

The issue tracker is open for any issues or suggestions you may have.

## Extra Notes

* I only have the Ancient Forest, Wildsprire Waste, and Hunter's Arsenal boxes. Feel free to add in things for other boxes.
* This is being made with the upcoming Iceborne board game in mind. As new information comes out for it, this expansion will probably change.
* You might need some extra dice and tokens
  * A token for each player's Palico
  * Some d8, d10, d12, and d20 for miscellaneous dice rolls
