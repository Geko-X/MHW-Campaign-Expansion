# Changes to Progression

## Weapons and Armor
Weapons and Armor forged are shared, however, **only one player may use a particular weapon class at a time**. This is due to not having enough minis or cards for multiple people playing the same class.

You may freely change weapons and armor before a hunt (as long as it has been forged).

## Materials
Materials gathered and carved are shared.  You can exchange materials at the Resource Centre in the following ratios:

* 3 of any common --> 1 specified common
* 5 of any common --> 1 specified non-common
* 3 of any non-common --> 1 specified non-common
* 10 of any material --> 1 specified monster part
* 3 of any monster part --> 1 specified monster part
* 3 of any common --> 1 health OR stamina potion
* 5 of any common --> 1 trap (once the Trapper has arrived)

When purchasing upgrades, you may also "automatically exchange" materials, regardless of if the Material Exchange upgrade has been purchased.

## Weapon Change Bonus
The Research Commission wants you to be proficient in all weapons classes. Using a weapon class that you've not used in the past 3 hunts will reward you an additional die during carving.

## Hunting License and Hunter Rank
You must level up your Hunting Rank to receive a license to hunt larger and stronger monsters. You gain +1 HR the first time you defeat a monster at a given level.

# Changes to Combat

## Player Actions

Play any combination of actions in any order, unless specified

* Play Attack Card.
* Walk - move 1 node for free.
* Sprint - play attack card face down, move the number of nodes specified by dodge value.
* Consume Items - play face up on stamina board, remove if hurt before your next turn. On next turn, the item is used.
  * Health potions completely heal health (set health dial to full).
  * Stamina potions completely refresh stamina (remove as many cards from stamina board as you want).
  * Whetstone (sharpen) - reshuffle damage discard into damage deck. Return whetstone to shared supply.
* Place Item - place an item on your node. You cannot attack when placing an item.
*   Trap - places a trap.
  * Monster Lure - places a lure.
* Short Rest / Take a Breather- remove 1 face up or 2 face down cards from your stamina board, but you cannot take any other action.

Once your actions are performed, perform hand maintenance by discard either 1 face up or 2 face down cards from anywhere on the Stamina Board, then draw and resolve a Time Card.

## Traps

Your party can carry 1 trap. Traps must be purchased from The Trapper.
When a monster moves into a trap, it immediately ends its turn.

You may also roll a d10 to attempt to capture the monster. If you roll higher than the monster's current health, you successfully capture the monster, and receive an additional d6 when rolling carves.

If you do not roll higher, you may resolve the player turns specified on the monster's current behaviour card. If you bring its health down to or below what was rolled, it is also successfully captured.

If you fail to capture the monster, it becomes enraged and its next behaviour card will have a player count of zero.

## Monster Lure

Your party can carry 1 monster lure. Lures must be purchased from The Trapper.

When a lure is used, it forces a Turf War to occur. If used in combat, is must be placed on a node. Another monster will then soon come from the closest edge node.

# Fainting
When you faint, immediately discard a time card. 

On your next turn, you may then discard an additional time card each to sharpen or clear your stamina board (ie: immediately discard a time card, then you wish to sharpen and clear your stamina board, so you discard another 2 time cards). Then reform your Action Deck by discarding your hand, combine your Action card discard and draw decks, shuffle them, and redraw your hand.

Finally, set your health to full and place your hunter on a starting node.

# Threat Shift

In addition to standard threat shifts, players can force themselves to become the highest or lowest threat by performing specific actions.

A player will immediately become the highest threat when they:
* Do a large amount of damage in a single turn (10%+ of monster HP).
* Play a block card.
* Inflict break.

A player will immediately become the lowest threat when they:
* Take a rest action.

# Time Cards 
### Roar
* Halve the cards lost, round down (ie: d3 instead of d6) 
* Players may place one card face down to stamina board to reduce 1 time card loss. Multiple players can place multiple cards.

### Poisoncups, Vespoids, Toads
All have a 1-point dodge value which you may elect to take when being hit. Falling boulders cannot be dodged.

# Weapons
### Insect Glaive
Reveal your next kinsect at the end of your current turn, before taking a time card and performing hand maintenance. When initially setting up, reveal your first kinsect.

_Note: this just lets you plan ahead a bit_

# Armor
* Alloy and Bone are considered White rarity at the Forge
* Jagras and Barroth sets are considered Yellow rarity at the forge
* Bone Chest no longer has the Slugger skill, instead it has "Paralysis Resist: You cannot suffer paralysis"
  * _This makes the Bone set against Tobi-Kadachi somewhat in line with the Alloy set against Pukei Pukei_

## Armor Skills
### Speed Eating
* Discard and resolve potions at the END of turn instead of at the start of your next turn.

# Changes to Scoutflies
Scoutflies can be used to "learn" information about a monster. More on this in the next section.

# Changes to Monsters
* **Monster physiology card information is hidden** and can be revealed using scoutflies, or during combat.
* At the end of a quest narrative, when revealing scoutfly tokens, the information about a monster can be learned for scoutfly points:
  * Monster element and ailment resistances (1 point each)
  * Monster part break values, and if something happens when a part is broken (1 point per part)
  * Monster part armor values (1 point per part)
  * Monster Ability (2 points)
* Monster elemental and ailment values revealed when triggering in combat, ie: stun in triggered, now know stun value.
* Health values are never known.

All information is remembered between hunts, so if you learn the fire resistance for a Great Jagras during your first encounter with it, you'll know it for the next encounter.

> [!TIP]
> It might be a good idea to record what you know about monsters in some sort of hunter notes...

## Turf Wars
Turf Wars are when another monster enters the fight.

Invading monsters start with less health that normal. Both monsters are considered a threat value of 10.

You may carve an invading monster if it is defeated, but no bonus carves can be applied.

# Downtime Activities

You may do any number of activities between hunts.

## Visit the Handler
As there is no Campaign Timer, quests can be repeated as often as needed, and there is no need to visit the Handler to replay a quest.

## Bounties
 
Bounties offer material rewards for completing certain objectives. Each player can hold one bounty at a time.  Bounties are completed automatically when the the player who collected the bounty achieves the objective. Bounty rewards are awarded when returning from a hunt.

### Picking Bounties
Bounties are picked randomly by rolling a d20. The player rolls 3 bounties and picks one. You may choose to discard a bounty at any time.

### Collecting Rewards
Roll a d12 to see what reward is collected. You may roll as many times as specified in the bounty reward.

### Bounty List and Rewards Table

The bounty list and rewards table can be found [here](bounties.md).

## Resource Centre Upgrades
The Resource Centre can be upgraded to allow additional Downtime Activities. Multiple upgrades can be purchased at once. Upgrades take time to apply, and will be completed after the next hunt.
 
Canteen and Smithy upgrades must happen in order.

## The Canteen
You can spend materials at the canteen to gain buffs for the next hunt. Only ONE player may benefit from a meal, but multiple players may order a meal.

## The Smithy
All weapons and armour forged are shared, however, these limits still apply:

* Only ONE of each weapon class can be used at a time.
* The appropriate copies of armour must be for forged for each person to wear it, ie: if 3 people want to wear the Great Jagras Headpiece then it must be forged 3 times.
* Previous weapons in a tree must have been made at least once.

## The Trapper
The Trapper sells tools to help your hunts. The Trapper stocks the following items. Her inventory is refreshed after a hunt.

| **Item**                 	| **Cost**                                                                            	| **Description**                                                                                                               	|

# Palico Training
Everyone can bring their Palico on a hunt.

Your Palico starts with your choice of any one Palico card. These must be unique across the party. 
You can spend materials to train your Palico and unlock a new ability to use. Your Palico can have a total of **four** abilities to choose from, but can only bring **one** on a hunt.

## Palico Combat

You can instead opt to forgo a Palico ability and instead equip your Palico for combat. Use your Palico token to track its position. A Palico has the same threat level as its Hunter, and uses the same part targeting rules as a Hunter.

During your turn, your Palico may:
* Move 1 node
* Attack - Roll a d6. Deal 1 damage for an odd result or 2 damage for an even result.
  * If a 6 is rolled, deal 1 Break as well.

If your Palico takes any damage, it faints and takes 3 monster turns to recover.
